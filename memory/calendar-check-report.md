# Calendar Check Report for 老里

**Check Time:** 2026-02-14 06:40 AM (GMT+8)  
**Period Checked:** Next 24-48 hours (Feb 14-16, 2026)

## Findings

### ❌ No Calendar Access Available

I attempted to check 老里's calendar for upcoming events, but **no calendar data could be accessed** for the following reasons:

1. **No Feishu Calendar Permissions**  
   The current Feishu integration has 19 granted permissions, but none include calendar access:
   - ❌ `calendar:calendar` - Not granted
   - ❌ `calendar:calendar:readonly` - Not granted
   - Available: messaging, documents, drive, wiki, contacts

2. **No Local Calendar File Found**  
   - Checked `/root/.openclaw/workspace/memory/` - no calendar data
   - No dedicated calendar file in the workspace
   - Daily notes (2026-02-14.md) contain no scheduled events

3. **No External Calendar Integration**  
   - No Google Calendar, Outlook, or other calendar APIs configured
   - No calendar URL or sync setup detected

## What This Means

**Currently, I cannot proactively check 老里's schedule.** To enable calendar monitoring, one of the following would need to be set up:

### Option 1: Grant Feishu Calendar Permissions (Recommended)
Add these scopes to the Feishu app:
- `calendar:calendar:readonly` - Read calendar events
- `calendar:calendar` - Manage calendar events

### Option 2: Create a Local Calendar File
Create `/root/.openclaw/workspace/memory/calendar.md` with upcoming events in a structured format:
```markdown
## 2026-02-14
- 14:00 | Team Meeting | Zoom link
- 18:00 | Article Deadline | OpenClaw tutorial

## 2026-02-15
- 10:00 | Content Review | With Director
```

### Option 3: iCal/Calendar URL
Provide a subscribe-able calendar URL (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.) that I can poll periodically.

## Immediate Action Needed

Since I cannot access the calendar, I recommend:

1. **Manual Check:** 老里 should manually review his 飞书日历 for the next 48 hours
2. **Setup Calendar Integration:** Choose one of the options above to enable automatic checking
3. **Update HEARTBEAT.md:** Add calendar check to daily routine once integration is ready
