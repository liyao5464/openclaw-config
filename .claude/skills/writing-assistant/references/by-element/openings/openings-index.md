## Opening #1

**Source:** Dan Koe - *The future of work when work is meaningless* (X/Twitter, 2026-01-21)

### Original Text

> Everyone is worried about whether or not AI will replace them.
>
> But I can't help but think that there is something about the human experience that can't be replaced.
>
> I can't help but think that humans will still want to work. That is, they will still want to create something, share it with another, and be recognized for their contribution by receiving some form of currency in return. This is a fundamental aspect of human nature, but it's unfortunate that "work" has become a dirty word stripped of meaning as productivity has become our God.
>
> I am less concerned with industrial factory-style work being automated. We all know what that soulless pit does to a person.
>
> I am much more concerned with creative work.
>
> What will that future look like?
>
> Will money become obsolete?
>
> Will AGI write all prose and create all art?
>
> If struggle, status, and curiosity are the generators of meaning, and AGI promises to rid us of such, what do we do?
>
> What is the one thing that AGI can't replace, if anything?
>
> In a world without scarcity, how do you become the scarce good?
>
> I want to share 6 ideas on the future of work, the skills and traits you must optimize for as a creative, and ultimately how to live a meaningful life in a future that feels daunting. I'll share both my own thoughts and theories that I believe hold relevant weight.
>
> And if you are a creative who wants to know if AI will ever replace your work, this is for you.
>
> (By the way, my articles are long. If you don't have time right now, bookmark it, but I don't expect this to please those with goldfish attention spans. My goal with these is for you to understand rather than collect a bunch of bullet points that sound nice but do nothing for you.)

### Analysis（分析）

**使用的技巧：**

1. **共鸣式开场（Empathy Hook）**："Everyone is worried about whether or not AI will replace them." 一句话精准捕捉读者当下的核心焦虑，让读者立刻觉得"这篇文章跟我有关"。

2. **立场反转（Contrarian Pivot）**："But I can't help but think..." 紧接着用"But"转折，表明作者有不同的看法。这是一种"先认同再引导"的策略——先承认大众的担忧，再暗示自己有更深的洞察。

3. **连珠炮式提问（Rapid-fire Questions）**：连续抛出6个问题（"What will that future look like?"、"Will money become obsolete?"等），每个问题都触及一个令人不安的可能性。这种技巧制造了强烈的信息缺口——读者脑中被激活了多个问题，急需答案。

4. **范围界定与价值承诺（Scope & Promise）**："I want to share 6 ideas on..." 明确告诉读者文章将提供什么，降低阅读的不确定性。读者知道自己将获得具体的收获。

5. **目标读者锁定（Audience Targeting）**："And if you are a creative who wants to know if AI will ever replace your work, this is for you." 直接点名目标读者，让符合条件的人觉得"这就是为我写的"。

6. **反筛选声明（Anti-filter Statement）**：括号中的备注——"I don't expect this to please those with goldfish attention spans"——这是一种反向筛选，把不认真的读者推走，同时让留下的读者产生归属感（"我不是那种注意力短暂的人"）。

**为什么有效：**

这个开头的核心逻辑是：**焦虑共鸣 → 独特立场 → 问题轰炸 → 价值承诺 → 读者筛选**。它在短短几段内完成了五件事：（1）建立相关性，（2）展示作者有独到见解，（3）制造大量好奇心，（4）承诺具体价值，（5）筛选出高质量读者。这是一个非常完整的开头架构。

## Opening #2

**Source:** Dan Koe - *The most important skill to learn in the next 10 years* (X/Twitter, 2026-01-08)

### Original Text

> Most skills will be irrelevant in 10-20 years.
>
> Well, maybe... That's what everyone's saying at least, and it definitely feels that way.
>
> But if you are a high agency individual, that doesn't matter. Why? Because you aren't dependent on a specific skill for your success. You aren't a specialist. You didn't focus your mind - preventing you from learning outside of that focus - on the status of a high paying job or degree. You have a vision, and you understand that in today's world, you can acquire any skill or any knowledge to achieve the life you want.
>
> Unfortunately, if your parents did not cultivate the skill of agency in themselves, they probably did not pass it off to you. And unless you have deliberately (and painfully) gone through the process of relearning, you have some work to do before you feel in control of your future.
>
> With that said:
>
> The most important skill to learn that will be relevant now, in 10 years, and until you die is agency. Because if you can set your own life direction, do what is required to achieve it, and avoid the infinite number of temptations and distractions in today's world, you will never be at risk of replacement (and if you do get replaced, it doesn't matter, because you can quickly adapt).
>
> I want to share 5 ideas on what agency is, why it matters more than ever, and how to practice it so you can get what you want in life.

### Analysis（分析）

**使用的技巧：**

1. **大胆断言开场（Bold Claim Hook）**："Most skills will be irrelevant in 10-20 years." 第一句就是一个让人心跳加速的断言，直接挑战读者对自身技能价值的信心。

2. **自我修正/真实感（Self-correction for Authenticity）**："Well, maybe... That's what everyone's saying at least" 紧接着自我修正，这个技巧非常巧妙——它让作者显得真实而非武断。这种"先说大话再稍微退一步"的方式，比纯粹的大胆断言更有说服力，因为它暗示作者是经过思考的。

3. **直接揭示答案（Early Reveal）**：不同于第一篇文章用悬念拖住读者，这篇文章在开头就直接揭示了答案——"agency"（主动性/能动性）。这种策略适用于核心论点需要大量论证的文章：先告诉你"是什么"，然后用整篇文章来说服你"为什么"。

4. **痛点触发（Pain Point Trigger）**："if your parents did not cultivate the skill of agency in themselves, they probably did not pass it off to you" 这句话触及了一个深层痛点——你的被动性可能不是你的错，但它确实是你的问题。这种方式既有共情，又制造了行动的紧迫感。

5. **结构预告（Structure Preview）**："I want to share 5 ideas on..." 与第一篇一样，明确告诉读者文章的结构和价值。

**为什么有效：**

这个开头的核心逻辑是：**恐惧触发 → 自我修正建立信任 → 提供解药（agency） → 痛点深挖 → 结构预告**。与第一篇的"问题轰炸"不同，这篇采用了"问题-答案-论证"的更直接路径。开头就给出了核心答案，但通过痛点触发和反直觉的定义（agency不是你以为的那种"主动性"），让读者有动力继续读下去。

## 开头模式总结

| 维度 | 文章一（Future of Work） | 文章二（Most Important Skill） |
|------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 第一句策略 | 共鸣式（点出大众焦虑） | 断言式（抛出惊人声明） |
| 悬念方式 | 连续提问，不给答案 | 直接给答案，但让你质疑理解 |
| 读者关系 | "我理解你的焦虑，但我有更深的思考" | "你可能缺少这个东西，让我告诉你" |
| 筛选机制 | 明确的反筛选（"goldfish attention spans"） | 隐含的筛选（"high agency individual"） |
| 价值承诺 | 6个想法 + 有意义的生活 | 5个想法 + 掌控人生 |

**Dan Koe 开头的共同DNA：**

- 总是从时代焦虑切入
- 总是在前几段内展示独特立场
- 总是有明确的价值承诺（"I want to share X ideas on..."）
- 总是通过某种方式筛选读者（明确或隐含）
- 语气自信但不傲慢，有"我也在思考这些问题"的真实感
