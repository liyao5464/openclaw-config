# The most important skill to learn in the next 10 years

Most skills will be irrelevant in 10-20 years.

Well, maybe... That's what everyone's saying at least, and it definitely feels that way.

But if you are a high agency individual, that doesn't matter. Why? Because you aren't dependent on a specific skill for your success. You aren't a specialist. You didn't focus your mind - preventing you from learning outside of that focus - on the status of a high paying job or degree. You have a vision, and you understand that in today's world, you can acquire any skill or any knowledge to achieve the life you want.

Unfortunately, if your parents did not cultivate the skill of agency in themselves, they probably did not pass it off to you. And unless you have deliberately (and painfully) gone through the process of relearning, you have some work to do before you feel in control of your future.

With that said:

The most important skill to learn that will be relevant now, in 10 years, and until you die is agency. Because if you can set your own life direction, do what is required to achieve it, and avoid the infinite number of temptations and distractions in today's world, you will never be at risk of replacement (and if you do get replaced, it doesn't matter, because you can quickly adapt).

I want to share 5 ideas on what agency is, why it matters more than ever, and how to practice it so you can get what you want in life.

## I - Agency is the ability to iterate without permission.

> It is only those who are in constant revolt that discover what is true, not the man who conforms, who follows some tradition.

– Krishnamurti

To understand what a high agency individual is, it is helpful to consider what it is not.

Agency is not mechanical conformity.

Conformity is when your mind is still connected by an umbilical cord to society.

Conformity is a stage of cognitive development where your mind operates entirely through cultural programming, judging truth based on popularity and acceptance by others rather than through your own direct experience or independent investigation.

If you really think about that, you understand that this is the greatest threat to living a good life.

When you are born, your mind is like a new computer. There is a base operating system, but the hard drive has nothing on it. For the first 20 years of your life, you do not think independently. And that's okay. Nobody does, no matter how independent you think you are, because most of the time that's just another form of conformity.

In the Spiral Dynamics and 9 stages of ego development models, they show that around 50% of the population is at the conformist stage of development. Meaning half the population lacks the cognitive development for genuine agency.

Conformity stems from survival. Humans don't only survive on the physical level like animals (reproducing genes), but on the psychological level (reproducing beliefs, ideas, and information).

If you work a job, you have a low degree of agency in that domain of life because if that job were to go away, your survival is at stake. So you must conform.

If you have hard-set beliefs that bind your identity to a specific religion or political party, you do not have a high degree of agency, because your ideas of good and bad originate from your culture, rather than personal scrutiny and discovery.

Everyone in the tech and business space loves to talk about being "high agency," yet that too is a form of conformity to what is popular in the tech and business space.

That said, this letter has a degree of conformity. We are all conformists in some way.

Now, what does true agency look like? And how can we start to develop it in ourselves so our emotions, finances, and opportunities in life are not dictated by someone else?

1) High agency people iterate without permission.

> To have agency is to be the subject of a sentence, rather than its direct object. It is the tendency to act, rather than wait to be acted upon.

– Devon Eriksen

Agency literally means "the condition of being in action or operation."

When used to describe a person, it means "the tendency to initiate action towards a goal without outside prompting, instruction, or permission."

But when we look at what actually makes people successful, it isn't just acting toward a goal. Anyone can start a business, but that doesn't mean they will reach any form of success. Most of them don't, in fact, because they're missing one critical piece of the puzzle:

If something doesn't work, you reflect on the situation, make an adjustment, and try again, over and over until you reach your end destination.

Agency, then, in my opinion, is not only action, but an undying commitment to iteration. Learning and doing in unison. Making mistakes and correcting mistakes without being seduced back into a comforting conformity because "it's not working."

2) High agency people treat life as one giant experiment.

Low agency people can be characterized by the "employee mindset."

They are assigned a task, often with some form of status or credential that triggers the part of their brain that craves acceptance by the tribe, and their decision-making is immediately compromised.

High agency people are scientists of their own lives.

They have an idea. They set their own goal. They create a hypothesis on how to achieve it. They test, tinker, research, and make an attempt toward the goal. They fail. A lot. But since this is an experiment, that's a part of the process.

3) High agency people believe in the difficult.

Low agency people suffer from a belief system that skews their perception of difficult goals.

The goal of reaching the life you want may be difficult, but you were trained to believe that there is no way to achieve it, so you don't even try.

## II - AI is not a threat to the high agency.

You now have access to any knowledge you would ever need to achieve whatever you want.

And yet... people still do nothing with that information.

That's a crucial point.

Success is now easier than ever, yet the people who weren't going to achieve it still aren't going to achieve it. Meaning, this was never about "access" or "equal opportunity." It's always been about agency.

High agency people, on the other hand, will outpace everyone else by 10x, because they act without permission, and the barriers to action are now close to non-existent.

Everyone is worried about the same thing.

And frankly, they're only afraid because they can't think clearly.

Let's look at a prime example: AI is going to create so much content that human creators don't stand a chance.

First, AI is a tool. Tools need someone to use them for a specific purpose.

When you ask AI to make all of the decisions for you, there is no throughline. There is no theme. There is no personality. There is no vision. There is no context. That's what creators are. Context creators, not content creators. The content is meaningless without context, and AI generations are the same.

99% of AI-generated content goes straight to the bottom of the barrel, because if the content worked, then the value is there, and it doesn't matter if AI generated it or not, because it was more than likely orchestrated by a human who is passing off their personal context to it.

In other words, nothing has changed, people just hate what's new, and that new is shining a light on what mattered in the first place. If you can't create art with AI, you were never an artist to begin with. You were simply good at using a tool like Photoshop. Tools get replaced. Vision and agency do not.

## III - Why generalists win in the AI age.

> Schools were created to enslave the brightest minds by promising the prestige of specialization so they remained narrow minded and didn't overthrow the true rulers.

Whenever I write about becoming a generalist, polymath, or someone with multiple interests, people come out of the woodwork to tell me how wrong I am.

They proceed to quote the classic from Shakespeare, "A jack of all trades is a master of none." Yet they are unaware of the fact that it is a misquote, and ends with "But oftentimes better than a master of one."

Specialists are attached to a skill. Skills evolve and get replaced as technology advances. Generalists, on the other hand, focus on the goal and do what's necessary so that they can thrive in anything they do.

Humans are tool builders. We thrive in any niche because we can adapt to it.

Society wants you simple, predictable, and easy to categorize. Because that's what best serves their interests.

What do you do?

You revolt against the path you were set on at birth. You pursue an interest-based education. You use your capabilities wisely.

## IV - The 5 human capabilities

Now, agency is great, but we are still bound by the laws of physics.

Will AGI (artificial general intelligence) make human intelligence irrelevant?

There are 5 fundamental human capabilities:

1) Computation (mental) - Is there any limit to what we can compute? No, because once you have a universal computer, it's just a matter of time and memory.

2) Transformation (physical) - Transformation is creation. We turn raw materials into rockets given the right knowledge. Is there a limit to what basic operations can do when strung together? No.

3) Variation - Is there a limit to the number of new ideas we can come up with? With computation, we can navigate the entire space of ideas. With agency, we can take any step within that space.

4) Selection - We can come up with any idea, but can we find the good ones? As universal cybernetic systems, we can become more efficient at navigating idea space. We error correct.

5) Attention - Our ability to change our focus by changing our perspective. We can put on a spiritual lens to find peace and a scientific lens to find progress.

AGI does not seem like it can surpass us in any way unless it bends what is possible.

## V - How to actually practice agency.

> In ordinary practical life, we usually take the means for the sake of the ends. But in games, we can take up an end for the sake of the means. Playing games can be a motivational inversion of ordinary life.

– C. Thi Nguyen, Games: Agency As Art

You develop agency by practicing other people's agencies until you are able to create your own. In other words, you play by the rules until you can create your own.

Agency, as a whole, is not a trait but an art form. The best way to observe that art form is in games.

Painting lets us record sights. Music lets us record sounds. Stories let us record narratives. Games let us record agencies.

First, you simply need something to pursue. Anything. Because nobody actually knows what they want. Instead, they deeply understand what they don't want, and allow that to create an aim for their future.

- Research processes that others have found success with.
- Experiment with various techniques.
- Identify patterns, principles, and levers.
- Create your own process.
- Pass it down to others.

This is why I love social media.

Aside from being an accessible, low-risk, and low-cost vessel to do what you want, learning and agency are baked in. It is the great modern game.

You can study other people's agencies in their content, guides, and courses.

You can experiment in public and get direct feedback.

You are forced to learn a future-proof skill stack (writing, persuasion, marketing, sales, storytelling, etc).

You must truly learn what you want to talk about on the internet.
