# Illustration 4: AI Hegemony Anxiety

**Type**: Scene
**Style**: Notion-style conceptual illustration, abstract and symbolic

**Prompt**:
A minimalist conceptual illustration showing two rising arrows side by side. The left arrow (labeled with Western tech symbols) looks cracked and nervous, with small stress lines around it. The right arrow (labeled with upward momentum) rises confidently. Between them, a dissolving wall/moat represented by fading bricks. Above the scene, text reads "护城河" (moat) with eroding effect. The composition suggests a shift in AI power balance. Soft gray tones with the rising arrow in soft blue/teal. Clean white background, thin black outlines, subtle shadows. Notion-style aesthetic, symbolic and modern.
