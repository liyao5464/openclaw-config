A minimalist infographic showing a bar chart comparison. On the left, a small bar labeled "16M API calls" with a small figure standing next to it looking confused. On the right, a much taller bar labeled "Normal API usage" that dwarfs the 16M bar. Above the small bar, a speech bubble says "This is industrial scale?" The bars are in soft gray with the 16M bar highlighted in light coral/red. Clean typography, simple icons, white background. Notion-style flat design with thin outlines. Data visualization aesthetic.
