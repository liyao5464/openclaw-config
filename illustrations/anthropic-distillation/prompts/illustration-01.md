# Illustration 1: The Tweet Backfire

**Type**: Scene
**Style**: Notion-style minimalist hand-drawn line art, clean vector style, limited color palette (black, gray, soft red accent)

**Prompt**:
A minimalist hand-drawn illustration showing a social media interface. In the center, a large speech bubble with the word "ATTACK" in bold red letters. Surrounding it are multiple smaller comment bubbles of various sizes, each containing simple icons: a balance scale (justice), a money symbol ($), a GitHub cat icon, an EU flag, a laughing face, and a shield. The largest comment bubble at the top shows "251" likes. The overall composition shows the central "ATTACK" message being overwhelmed by counter-arguments. Clean white background, thin black outlines, subtle gray shadows. Notion-style aesthetic, simple and modern.

**Aspect Ratio**: 16:9
