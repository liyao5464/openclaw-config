A clean notion-style decision flowchart for choosing AI tools. Start node at top: "选工具？" with a simple question mark icon. First branch: "有预算?" → Yes → "选首选" (green badge) / No → second node "有特定需求?" → Yes → "选平替" (yellow badge) / No → "用免费" (gray badge). Simple rectangular nodes with rounded corners, thin arrow lines, hand-drawn notion aesthetic. Each end node shows example tool names in small text. White background, minimal black line art, generous spacing, no decorative elements.
